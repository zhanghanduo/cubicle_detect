# YOLO V3 for ROS: Real-Time Object Detection for stereo images

## Overview

This is a ROS package developed for object detection for stereo images. What we are doing is acquire the 3D position of detected objects by using stereo matching.
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. In the following ROS package you are able to use YOLO on GPU and CPU.
The pre-trained model of the convolutional neural network is able to detect pre-trained classes including the data set from VOC, COCO and BDD100K dataset.
For more information about YOLO, Darknet, available training data and training YOLO see the following link: [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

**Note**: If you just want to run regular monocular image detection using YOLO and ROS, please visit the [darknet_ROS repository](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros).

The YOLO stereo ROS packages have been tested under ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04.

Thanks to the original author:Author: [Marko Bjelonic](https://sites.google.com/site/bjelonicmarko/). I have to say sorry as I did not fork that repo because the submodule [darknet](https://github.com/zhanghanduo/darknet) has been modified.

## Installation

### Dependencies

This software is built on the Robotic Operating System ([ROS]), which needs to be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org) first. Additionally, YOLO for ROS depends on following software:

- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (computer vision library),
- [boost](http://www.boost.org/) (c++ library),
- [obstacle_msgs](https://github.com/zhanghanduo/obstacle_msgs.git)

**Note**: If you encounter such error: `No rule to make target '/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/libopencv_calib3d3.so'`, please modify the `CMakeLists.txt` in `darknet_ros` folder
and uncomment the line 102: `set(OpenCV_DIR $ENV{HOME}/OPENCV_SOURCE_CODE/release)` with the opencv source code you have placed. release is the folder where your `cmake_install.cmake` lies.


### Building

In order to install darknet_ros, clone the latest version using SSH (see [how to set up an SSH key](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html)) from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd catkin_workspace/src
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:zhanghanduo/cubicle_detect.git
    cd ../

To maximize performance, make sure to build in *Release* mode. You can specify the build type by setting

    catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

or using the [Catkin Command Line Tools](http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)

    catkin build darknet_ros -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

We recommend you to use an Nvidia GPU and you'll have to install CUDA (CUDNN is recommended).
The CMakeLists.txt file automatically detects if you have CUDA&CUDNN installed or not.
If you are compiling with CUDA, you might receive the following build error:

    nvcc fatal : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_61'.

This means that you need to check the compute capability (version) of your GPU. You can find a list of supported GPUs in CUDA here: [CUDA - WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs). Simply find the compute capability of your GPU and add it into darknet_ros/CMakeLists.txt. Simply add a similar line like

    -O3 -gencode arch=compute_62,code=sm_62

### Download weights

The yolo3.weights is downloaded automatically in the CMakeLists.txt file. If you need to download them again, go into the weights folder and download the pre-trained weights from the COCO data set:

    cd catkin_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/weights/
    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

### Use your own detection objects

In order to use your own detection objects you need to provide your weights and your cfg file inside the directories:

    catkin_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/weights/
    catkin_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/cfg/

Download BDD trained weight:

```
wget https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/hzhang032_e_ntu_edu_sg/ETEhLBRKDJlIgBINsJa48X8BjJO1ghSNOl1yoaqGcSwVxw?e=wWlPYb
```
In addition, you need to create your config file for ROS where you define the names of the detection objects. You need to include it inside:

    catkin_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/config/

Then in the launch file you have to point to your new config file in the line:

    <rosparam command="load" ns="darknet_ros" file="$(find darknet_ros)/config/your_config_file.yaml"/>

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests using the [Catkin Command Line Tools](http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)

    catkin build darknet_ros --no-deps --verbose --catkin-make-args run_tests

You will see the image above popping up.

## Basic Usage

In order to get YOLO ROS: Real-Time Object Detection for ROS to run with your robot, you will need to adapt a few parameters. It is the easiest if duplicate and adapt all the parameter files that you need to change from the `darkned_ros` package. These are specifically the parameter files in `config` and the launch file from the `launch` folder.

## Nodes

### Node: darknet_ros

This is the main YOLO ROS: Real-Time Object Detection for ROS node. It uses the camera measurements to detect pre-learned objects in the frames.

### ROS related parameters

You can change the names and other parameters of the publishers, subscribers and actions inside `darkned_ros/config/ros.yaml`.

#### Subscribed Topics

* **`/camera_reading`** ([sensor_msgs/Image])

    The camera measurements.

#### Published Topics

* **`object_detector`** ([std_msgs::Int8])

    Publishes the number of detected objects.

* **`bounding_boxes`** ([obstacle_msgs])

    Publishes an array of bounding boxes that gives information of the position and size of the bounding box in pixel coordinates.

* **`detection_image`** ([sensor_msgs::Image])

    Publishes an image of the detection image including the bounding boxes.


### Detection related parameters

You can change the parameters that are related to the detection by adding a new config file that looks similar to `darkned_ros/config/yolo.yaml`.

* **`image_view/enable_opencv`** (bool)

    Enable or disable the open cv view of the detection image including the bounding boxes.

* **`image_view/wait_key_delay`** (int)

    Wait key delay in ms of the open cv window.

* **`yolo_model/config_file/name`** (string)

    Name of the cfg file of the network that is used for detection. The code searches for this name inside `darkned_ros/yolo_network_config/cfg/`.

* **`yolo_model/weight_file/name`** (string)

    Name of the weights file of the network that is used for detection. The code searches for this name inside `darkned_ros/yolo_network_config/weights/`.

* **`yolo_model/threshold/value`** (float)

    Threshold of the detection algorithm. It is defined between 0 and 1.

* **`yolo_model/detection_classes/names`** (array of strings)

    Detection names of the network used by the cfg and weights file inside `darkned_ros/yolo_network_config/`.
